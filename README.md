This is the backbone of an application that I am currently working on that utilizes data science to identify sign language and translate to text. This is especially important as the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that over 1.5 billion people are affected by hearing impairment and this number is projected to rise to 2.5 billion by 2050. With more than 50% of these individuals actively employed in the workforce, it is crucial for the rest of the population to be able to communicate with them using ASL. To accomplish this task, I have trained multiple neural network models on a large dataset of sign language images and corresponding transcriptions in written language. Through this process, the model will learn to generate text associated with sign language gestures for a given input text sequence.
